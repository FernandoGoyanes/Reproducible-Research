# Impact of Severe Weather in the US

## About

This is the second project for the Reproducible Research course in Coursera's Data Science specialization track. The purpose of the project was to determine which storm event(s) had the most significant economic and health effects.

## Synopsis

The purpose of the assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and analyse the effects of severe weather events on both population and economy. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The database covers the time period between 1950 and November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

The analysis aims to investigate which different types of sever weather events are most harmful on the populations health in respect of general injuries and fatalities. Further the economic consequences will be analyzed by exploring the financial damage done to both general property and agriculture (i.e. crops).
